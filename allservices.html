 	 	<ul>
 	 		<li>Anchoring the design and refinement of the selection criteria and detailed admissions process</li>
 	 		<li>Hand-holding the execution of the sequence of effort leading to submission of applications, organizing the interview experience, communication of decisions, securing acceptances and ensuring retention</li>
 	 		<li>Overseeing and supporting the scholarship award process</li>
 	 		<li>Providing training and guidance to team on nuances of engagement with students and other influencers in the decision making process for the student</li>
 	 	</ul>
 	 	<h3>The quality of communication with students in any form or channel plays a critical role in converting prospective applications to registered students. Since our brand philosophy also entails that sincerity and uncompromising commitment to the student’s best interest can go a long way in achieving the goals & helps the institute to embrace their true brand value.</h3>
