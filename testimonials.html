						"It was mid of march my CAT and XAT results were out and the very next thing I needed in my life was proper counseling. So Abhinav sir’s call came totally out of blue. I mean I wasn’t expecting to get that much proper guidance post any of the exams. He explained to me the criteria for admission to any of the B-School. And then we finalized BML Munjal University. He along with Pankaj Tewari sir explained to me the dynamic curriculum of that college and what all new companies have recently tied up with BML Munjal.<br><br>
						He helped me with the admission procedure and also kept Pankaj sir in the loop to give that “GURU GYAN” to me whenever I needed it. He also helped me with Bridge program and made sure that I perform all the activities with 100% zeal. Nonetheless, he is still connected with me and constantly keeps in touch regarding any of the issues I am facing over here. All in all, I want to thank Abhinav, Pankaj Sir, and Whole elevator academy. I hope they continue doing this mentoring program and help students who are in dire need of proper guidance."

					<h5>"Preparing from a CAT and management entrance test preparation Centre can only help an individual upto a certain extent, but getting a proper career guidance post an individual’s entrance scores can boost one’s career graph in an amazing way. This phrase has been exactly the same in my scenario. As an aspirant I was pretty much scepticist; my entrance scores were pretty average, and I was uncertain of whether to continue for my MBA or should I drop it. A constant discussion with my seniors & friends related to this scenario left me even more chaotic. Then came this marvellous person to my rescue, Pankaj Sir who not only gave me the sheer confidence of pursuing my management career ahead but also helped me throughout the entire admission process. </h5>
					<h5>
						By providing me with an entire analysis and research of important parameters (students intake, to precise placement facts, figures and profiles, return on investment criteria, to analysis of faculties and discussing about their pedagogy) which are considered of utmost importance while selecting a b-school. I am extremely thankful for his extensive guidance which had helped me in getting into a great business school. Pankaj Sir’s persistent support has help me sailed smoothly throughout the 2 years of my MBA journey. I can always vouch for his credible career counselling practices which has help shaped many amazing careers; including mine."

					<h5>“All great changes are preceded by chaos.” – Deepak Chopra. <br>"This quote has always been a true testament as far as my career is concerned. Yes it’s been true that after my post-graduation; my career has been shaped all differently and is growing at a rapid pace. A big thanks to my mentor Pankaj Sir and his team Elevator’s Academy who had helped me by making me come out of this chaos (P.S. my academic brilliance). He has been a guiding force ever since my friend introduced me to this effervescent powerhouse of knowledge as far as management education is concerned. I was truly amazed by the sheer knowledge which was shared with me in terms of selecting a business school is concerned. How students intake of a b-school, placement facts, figures and profiles of the b-school aspirants, return on investment are of an utmost importance. The ace analysis of these parameters vis-à-vis immersion experience (A one and a half day stay at the b-school premises where all your queries are answered by the existing students) of the b-school is a true amalgamation of the best-in-class career counselling they do at Elevator’s Academy. I can firmly corroborate for an effective career counselling prowess by this magnificent company which I am sure will bring great changes in an individual’s career."</h5>
